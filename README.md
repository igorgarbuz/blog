# Simple Astro blog project for technical and scientific writing

My writing space I starting from a need to own my writing as not existing solution seemed to find something I was looking for. Main requirements were: SSG, markdown support, extendable with Remark/Rehype plugins, lightweight for fast loading and easy to deploy. I also wanted to have a default dark mode, proper code syntax highlighting.

## Features wishlist
