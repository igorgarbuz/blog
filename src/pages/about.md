# hi ðŸ‘‹ !

I'm Igor, a freelance software engineer. My main interests spin around AI and web technologies.
I enjoy building things that people use and love.

Free time faves are tinkering with HW and SW, long distance running and reading.

You can reach me on X [@igarbuz](https://twitter.com/igarbuz) or by email `ig [at] rbuz.me`
